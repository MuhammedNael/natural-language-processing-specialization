# **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization by DeepLearning.AI**  

This repository showcases my completed projects and coursework from the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization by DeepLearning.AI**, designed and taught by **Younes Bensouda Mourri** (Stanford AI Instructor) and **≈Åukasz Kaiser** (Google Brain Research Scientist). Through this specialization, I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience in building state-of-the-art NLP systems using deep learning techniques.  

## **Highlights of What I‚Äôve Learned**  
- **NLP with Classification and Vector Spaces**: Implemented sentiment analysis, word analogies, and translation using logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, word vectors, and locality-sensitive hashing for nearest neighbor search.  
- **NLP with Probabilistic Models**: Built auto-correction, auto-completion, and part-of-speech tagging systems with dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings.  
- **NLP with Sequence Models**: Designed advanced NLP models using dense and recurrent neural networks (LSTMs, GRUs) and Siamese networks for sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and duplicate question detection.  
- **NLP with Attention Models**: Developed machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems using encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention mechanisms, including T5, BERT, and transformer models.  

## **Technologies & Tools**  
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, ü§ó Transformers  
- Word Embeddings (GLoVe, Word2Vec), Vector Space Models  
- Transformers (BERT, T5), LSTMs, GRUs, Siamese Networks  
- Dynamic Programming, Hidden Markov Models, Attention Mechanisms
